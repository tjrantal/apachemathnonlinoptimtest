[Apache math optimisation sample test](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/userguide/optimization.html).

Testing Apache math optimisation. Confirmed that Octave optimisation gives the same result (src/octave folder).
Build with gradle (downloads the Apache Math 3.6.1 dependency for you).
Utilises JavaFX for visualisation (either use oracle Java in linux, or install the prerequisite packages to work with openjdk...)


Not finished yet. Tried non-linear sample but I was not satisfied with the result (i.e. I stuffed it up somewhere).
